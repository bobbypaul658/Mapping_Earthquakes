#  Mapping Earthquakes
 Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map. Since information is in real time, the map will update whenever they access it. Scripts are built using java script and mapbox using the leaflit libarary.
